				<p>Biography
					Sarah grew up on Figure Eight Island, and is considered a Kook. Her father is a self-made entrepreneur and built the family business from the ground up. Sarah describes him as being like John B when he was younger.

					Sarah has an older brother, Rafe, and a younger sister, Wheezie. She lives with her father and her stepmother, Rose, with whom she has a relatively strained relationship. At the beginning of season one, she is close to her father and says that she can't imagine life without him.

					In the ninth grade, Sarah was best friends with Kiara, but the friendship ended abruptly when Sarah began to feel claustrophobic in the friendship. She has had a number of boyfriends in the past but no relationship ever lasted. This, Sarah tells John B, is because she finds herself pushing boys away whenever she starts to get serious with them. Prior to the pilot she started going out with Topper, who is also a Kook. Sarah is interested in the environment and has an easy-going and fun-loving attitude.

				<p>Kiara Carrera is one of the main characters in Outer Banks. She is portrayed by Madison Bailey.

She is an athletic hippy chick with a socialist streak, and although she’d loathe to admit it, she’s from a rich family meaning that she is a Kook. Kiara fits in perfectly with the Pogues; she’s got a cutting sense of humor, a zen vibe, and a taste for adventure.Biography
Kiara is the only child of Mike and Anna Carrera. Her mother Anna was born into money and is from Figure Eight, while her father Mike rose from a less privileged Pogue background to start a very successful local restaurant called The Wreck (where Kie works for her parents). Anna's pregnancy by Mike was unplanned and out of wedlock, which initially jeopardized Anna's financial and social standing - as a result, Anna is extremely protective of Kie and apprehensive about her friendship with the Pogue boys. However, she and Mike happily married and built a very stable, well-off household for Kie with the best possible opportunities, including moving to the Figure Eight and enrolling Kie in the same school all the Kooks went to.


SHE IS ALWAYS FOR HER FRIENDS SHE IS ALWAYS SOLD THEIR PROBLEMS
Personality:
Kiara is a very loyal and caring friend. She often feels torn between the Pogues and her parents, who dislike the boys because they are poor and bad influence. Even though she is one of the more responsible people in the Pogues and usually shoots down JJ's ideas for a better, safe plan, Kiara seems to like the dangers of their adventure.

				<p>JJ and Kiara are best friends. They look out for each other and protect one another. They also care a lot about each other, Kiara always being there for JJ when he has to confront his home life, and JJ comforting Kie when her parents aren’t the best.

In Season 2, JJ and Kiara are still best friends. Kie saves JJ at the end of S2 Episod . Kiara's friendship with John B, JJ, and Pope are a point of contention between her and her parents. While her father, Mike Carrera, appears to have been brought up working class, her mother was born into wealth and grew up on the Figure Eight -- and each of them want better for Kie than life in the Cut. There is particular tension between Kie and her mother, Anna, as Anna wants Kiara to experience the privilege and opportunities she did growing up in the Figure Eight, but Kiara has little interest in country clubs or her privileged, wealthy peers.Kiara has a less strained relationship with Mike, her father, and they seem to spend a good deal of time together as she works with him at his restaurant, The Wreck. He is shown to be more accepting of his daughter's Pogue lifestyle and her friends from The Cut. Mike doesn't like that Kiara is a Pogue, but he understands that JJ, John B, and Pope are Kiara's best friends</p>
