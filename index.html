She has had a number of boyfriends in the past but no relationship ever lasted. This, Sarah tells John B, is because she finds herself pushing boys away whenever she starts to get serious with them.

				<p>Kiara Carrera is one of the main characters in Outer Banks. She is portrayed by Madison Bailey.

She is an athletic hippy chick with a socialist streak, and although she’d loathe to admit it, she’s from a rich family meaning that she is a Kook. Kiara fits in perfectly with the Pogues; she’s got a cutting sense of humor, a zen vibe, and a taste for adventure.Biography
Kiara is the only child of Mike and Anna Carrera. Her mother Anna was born into money and is from Figure Eight, while her father Mike rose from a less privileged Pogue background to start a very successful local restaurant called The Wreck (where Kie works for her parents). Anna's pregnancy by Mike was unplanned and out of wedlock, which initially jeopardized Anna's financial and social standing - as a result, Anna is extremely protective of Kie and apprehensive about her friendship with the Pogue boys. However, she and Mike happily married and built a very stable, well-off household for Kie with the best possible opportunities, including moving to the Figure Eight and enrolling Kie in the same school all the Kooks went to.

The transition to life and school in the Figure Eight was very hard for Kie; she had trouble connecting with her peers, making friends, etc. However, when she met Sarah Cameron, they struck up a friendship and Kie began to find the acceptance that had eluded her up until that point. Kiara and Sarah were best friends in the Ninth Grade, to the point that Kie neglected her friendship with Pogue boys John B, JJ, and Pope. However, she and Sarah became enemies in the Tenth Grade when Sarah snubbed Kie on the invite list of one of her parties, then spread a rumor that Kie was the reason the party was broken up by police. After having fallen out with Sarah, Kiara reconnected with the Pogues. Shortly after John B involves Sarah in their hunt for the Royal Merchant gold, the rest of the Pogues strand them on a boat together to work out their differences - Sarah comes to an epiphany and apologizes, telling Kie "When people get close to me, I feel trapped, and I bail, and then I blame them for it. I'm really sorry, and I miss you."

SHE IS ALWAYS FOR HER FRIENDS SHE IS ALWAYS SOLD THEIR PROBLEMS
Personality:
Kiara is a very loyal and caring friend. She often feels torn between the Pogues and her parents, who dislike the boys because they are poor and bad influence. Even though she is one of the more responsible people in the Pogues and usually shoots down JJ's ideas for a better, safe plan, Kiara seems to like the dangers of their adventure.

Kiara is determined and stubborn and doesn't like her parents' ideals, which is why she chooses the Pogues over them.
